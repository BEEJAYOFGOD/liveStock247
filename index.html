        <h2>Everything Livestock</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            Our goal at Livestock247 is to improve the efficiency of livestock
            production in Nigeria and Africa as a whole, particularly
            productivity per animal through our animal identification process,
            as well as mitigating the spread of zoonotic diseases through
            sensitization and awareness of diseases dangerous to both humans and
            animals, in order to double livestock productivity while halving its
            negative environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, we aim to establish an environment in which all major
            stakeholders in the livestock value chain may coexist and produce
            synergy. Livestock247 is also encouraging agricultural change by
            empowering rural livestock farmers, particularly women.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our VISION is to leverage technology to mainstream Africa's
            livestock business. We aim to achieve our objective by creating
            goods that include the following features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Capability to buy and sell slaughter-ready and traceable animals
              from anywhere.
            </li>
            <li>
              Capability to purchase and have delivered healthy and hygienically
              prepared meat from anyplace.
            </li>
            <li>
              Capability to provide high-quality animal health services to rural
              livestock owners.
            </li>
            <li>
              Capability to hold qualitative discussions with veterinary
              doctors, animal production experts, and enthusiasts via online
              conferences and forums
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The livestock discussion has been on how to boost productivity while
            being environmentally responsible. The UN 2030 Agenda for
            Sustainable Development has given the discussion a new and larger
            dimension. It has switched the conversation's focus from supporting
            sustainable production in general to boosting the sector's
            contribution to the accomplishment of the Sustainable Development
            Goals (SDGs).
